# How to run this project:
## With Docker:
### Prerequisites
- Docker

### Steps:
1. Clone this repo 
2. `cd docker` 
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. Open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`


## Without Docker:
*(Are you sure you want to do this?)*

Never ran it without docker, but I guess you should do: 
1. Clone this repo
2. Composer install
3. Symfony server:start
4. Open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`

If not, please let me know and I'll try to help you out. (Or just install Docker...)
